Introduction:
This project is to create a botnet in android OS.

We use Sms and Internet to let the botnet communicate
with each other.

Framework:
The project can be seperate into three components:
a. Receiver component:
	this component will receive the message from the master bot
	or other bot and handle the command to the command component.
b. Command component:
	the component will handle the command and do what the command
	ask the machine to do.
c. Auxiliary component:
	the component will help the program work nicely, and prevent 
	the program to crash down.
